In this paper, we explore the potential of edge computing for the real-time classification of leaf diseases using thermal imaging. We introduce a novel dataset of thermal images that encompasses a range of plant diseases. We also demonstrate the use of optimized deep learning models such as InceptionV3, MobileNetV1, MobileNetV2, and VGG-16, which employ pruning and quantization-aware training for deployment on resource-constrained devices like the Raspberry Pi 4b. Remarkably, these optimized models achieve inference times that surpass those of high-end GPUs such as the RTX3090, and they deliver state-of-the-art accuracy. These results demonstrate the potential of edge computing for time-sensitive applications.
